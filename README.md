README

This is a collection of java utilities used for modelling the interaction
of the local neutral interstellar medium and the heliosphere.  Gravitation, 
ionization, sources and losses are taken into account.  Integration routines
and graphical interfaces are included.  

However there is little to no documentation.  If you use this resource
please acknowlege Dr. Lukas Saul at the University of Bern.  Contact me 
for any questions about the usage of these codes.  

HelioVector is a java object for keeping track of positions and velocities
in the heliosphere. 

NeutralDistribution calculates the velocity distribution at a given point
in the heliosphere.  

Adding this to a github archive in Feb. 2014.
